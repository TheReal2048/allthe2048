### Battery saving techiques:
This game contains high graphic images (GIF and PNG files) which are very large and could drain your battery fast.
If you have a computer or a laptop, no worries. :smile:

## Project work?
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub, which means there are some hosting costs.

Enjoy the game!
